# Single Responsibility BEM

Single Responsibility BEM is a DRYer way to write BEM-style CSS with Sass. I came up with the concept because I was annoyed with having to repeat the block before an element and modifier. Seriously. Over time, it became a system you can adapt to your workflow for more cohesive, easily maintainable styling and markup. You can read about Single Responsibility BEM in [my post with the same title][1].

## Main Features

### Block Encapsulation

### Element Scope

### The ```.augment``` Namespace
