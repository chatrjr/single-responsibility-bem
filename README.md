# Single Responsibility BEM

Single Responsibility BEM is a DRYer way to write BEM-style CSS with Sass. I came up with the concept because I was annoyed with having to repeat the block before an element and modifier. I decided to flesh it out and share with the web community in the hopes of making things easier for solo developers and teams alike. You can read more about Single Responsibility BEM in [my post with the same title][1].

## Main Features

### Block Encapsulation

### Element Scope
